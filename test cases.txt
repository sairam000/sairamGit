Test cases 1:

positive scenario:

pass different json input in which one of the input must have overweight

check the output count of overweight

which can be calculated by formula:
	BMI_Formula=weight/height;
	where height = height/100;
	     height = height*height;

the expected count should match with the code output

Test cases 2:

negative scenario:

pass different json input in which one of the input should not contain oveweight

check the output count of overweight which should be zero

formula same as above:

Test case 3:

pass empty input then it should print the input is empty
